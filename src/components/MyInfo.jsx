            <h4>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h4>
            <p>I am a Junior Software Engineer with a passion in full-stack and mobile development. I am currently a student at California State University, Monterey Bay and I have an experience wirking as a Teachers 
              Assistant at a coding bootcamp Code Platoon.
            </p>
            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>I learned to develop front-end, back-end, and full-stack applications during my intership at Code Platoon, a coding bootcamp that serves military personnel and military spouses. I worked as a Teacher's Assistant, and my main purpose was 
              assisting students in their assignments, which meant I had to learn and adapt to the material fast in order to be a resourceful TA.
